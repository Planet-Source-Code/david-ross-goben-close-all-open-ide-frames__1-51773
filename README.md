## Close All Open IDE Frames


</div>

### Description

Really simple, but VERY useful, Add-In project with almost no code. This allows you to close all open Form and Code frames in the VB IDE. Great introduction to beginners on how to write a simple Add-in utility, which you can access from the Add-Ins menu. This was something I wrote when I was a new (baby) VB developer. It broke the ice on add-ins, and demonstrated that there was nothing scary about them, but that they are just like regular VB projects that are simply built into the IDE. It also demonstrates accessing the VBInstance object, which is our hook into the Integrated Development Environment, allowing us to potentially programmically add forms and files to a project, insert lines into source code (I have a VB Development Header add-in that I will be uploading to demonstrate this).
